# Ping Pong TDD 🏓

## Exercise 1
Given an array of ints, find the first number which occurs an odd number of times.

For example:
```
[0] -> returns 0 as 0 occurs 1 time
[2] -> returns 2 as 2 occurs 1 time
[1,1,2] -> returns 2, because it occurs 1 time.
[1,1,2,3,3,4] -> returns 2, because it is the first number to occur an odd number of times.
[1,2,1,2] -> returns None, as no item occurs an odd number of times.
```

## Exercise 2
TBC 😝

## Ping pong flow
* Person 1 writes a failing test
* Person 2 writes the code to make the test green
* Person 2 writes a failing test
* Person 2 writes the code to make the test green

You can refactor on green. The person not driving cannot write any code.
